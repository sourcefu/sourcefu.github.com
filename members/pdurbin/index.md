I started the #sourcefu IRC channel (where I went by "pdurbin") and used to log it at <http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/>. When freenode fell apart we killed the #sourcefu channel but you can see the first day on <http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2012-11-28/> and pretty much the last day on <http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2021-05-04/>. It was fun while it lasted! You can find a full backup at <https://github.com/pdurbin/irclog.greptilian.com>.

<http://greptilian.com> is my website, where you can find links to my various accounts online. My projects can be found at <https://github.com/pdurbin>

I authored most of the sourcefu home page, including our guiding principles, and created the [sourcefu logo](/logo).
