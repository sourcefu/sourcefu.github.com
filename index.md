sourcefu was a software development community with an emphasis on friendliness, transparency, and open source.

We used to log our IRC channel publicly at [http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu](http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/) because "[we live in a world of infinitely searchable micro-content, and every contribution, however small, enriches all of us](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/when-in-doubt-make-it-public.html)."

Our IRC channel was on freenode and when it fell apart, our channel went with it. You can see the first day of chatter at <http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2012-11-28/> and pretty much the last day at <http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2021-05-04/>. You can find a full backup at <https://github.com/pdurbin/irclog.greptilian.com>. It was good while it lasted!

Some of us are still on the codecraft mailing list, which is mentioned below.

## Guiding principles

* None of us is as smart as all of us
* Open source by default
* [When in doubt, make it public](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/when-in-doubt-make-it-public.html)

## About the name sourcefu

<img src="/img/gongfu.svg" alt="gongfu" width="50px" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 5px"/>

"fu" is short for the Chinese word gōngfu (功夫) which means "[any study, learning, or practice that requires patience, energy, and time to complete][wikipedia-kungfu]."

"-fu" appears in The Jargon File as "[expert practice of a skill][jargonfile-fu]" but in "sourcefu" the hypen was removed to [keep it short][unix-short]. :)
